# Apache VCL Client

Apache VCL (and in particular, [NC State's version of it](https://vcl.ncsu.edu)) contains an XMLRPC endpoint for creating virtual machines. The only way to start these VMs is through the web interface. A CLI client for quick VM startups/shutdowns is very helpful for a computer science student needing temporary remote compute resources.
